1. Register you web application and get your Client ID and Secret form Runkeeper's Partner Portal Web Site

https://runkeeper.com/partner

2. Generate your access token

To generate your access token, you have to run the following command in terminal window:
  a. gem install launchy rack
  b. Run bundle install
  b. CLIENT_ID=“your Client ID” CLIENT_SECRET=“your Client Secret”
     AUTHORIZATION_URL=“https://runkeeper.com/apps/authorize”
     ACCESS_TOKEN_URL=“https://runkeeper.com/apps/token” token_generator

     ---- note: this is a one line command ----
     
  c. The command will open a browser window with Runkeeper's website login
  d. Return to your terminal windows and your token will be displayed if your login was successful

Check this website where I found the procedure: http://www.vinnycoyne.com/post/56247548995/send-jawbone-up-sleep-data-to-runkeeper

3. Add following line to add HTTParty gem in your Gemfile

gem 'httparty'

From a terminal windows run the command: bundle install
This will install latest version of HTTParty Gem

4. I recommend you to check the following site for further information on HTTParty and Runkeeper's API example calls

a. http://www.rubydoc.info/github/jnunemaker/httparty/HTTParty/ClassMethods
b. https://runkeeper.com/developer/healthgraph/example-api-calls#top

4. Modify your routes. Add a activity resource for this example. You can modify to suite your needs.

resources :activities

5. Create your controller with the following code:

class ActivitiesController < ApplicationController

  def index
    @user = Activity.grab_user
    @activities = Activity.grab_activities
  end
  
end

6. Create a environment variable with your token code

Add the following to your .bash_profile

export RUN_KEEPER_TOKEN="xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx"

replace "xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx" with your token code

7. Create your model with the following code:

class Activity
  include HTTParty

  hostport = "api.runkeeper.com"
  base_uri "http://#{hostport}"
  format :json

  def self.grab_user
    headers 'Authorization' => 'Bearer ENV["RUN_KEEPER_TOKEN"]', 'Accept' => "application/vnd.com.runkeeper.User+json"
    get("/user")
  end

  def self.grab_activities
    headers 'Authorization' => 'Bearer ENV["RUN_KEEPER_TOKEN"]', 'Accept' => "application/vnd.com.runkeeper.FitnessActivityFeed+json"
    get("/fitnessActivities")["items"]
  end
end

8. Create your view file as follows (index.html.erb):

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>Type</th>
      <th>Start Time</th>
      <th>Total Distance</th>
      <th>Duration</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <% @activities.each do |activity| %>
      <tr>
        <td><%= activity["type"] %></td>
        <td><%= activity["start_time"].to_s %></td>
        <td><%= activity["total_distance"].to_i / 1000 %> Kms</td>
        <td><%= activity["duration"] %></td>
      </tr>
    <% end %>
  </tbody>
</table>
